Drconfused strikes again!
Now that a18 is out my dedication is solely towards this new version but now I need to get the game to fit my style of play. I enjoy a little more of the mining and crafting variation and don't much care for a huge amount of travel.

	What this mod does;
More gear to start with;
Flannel Shirt, Worn Boots, Overalls, bike, Pistol and ammo. Removes the start quests and hops you right to having to locate the Trader.
Upon finding the trader you are gives 4 skill points, wrench, hammer, auger, chainsaw, gas, and a Trader spawn block so that you can have a trader right in your own base!
