	So you find the gathering of materials and crafting all the things to be a tedious and redundant exercise in patience? Well so do I and so does the Trader. The Trader see's your inherent value and that you are motivated to collect materials and he has already established a trade network and is in constant need to supply his network with crafting materials. 

	Must craft one of the Work Orders to unlock the recipes to allow you to craft the specific work orders.
	Trade for the following materials:
	<!-- Materials -->
		Cement
		Cobblestone
		Concrete Mix
		Forged Iron
		Forged Steel

		Rebar Frames
		






Random Thoughts

	Should the objects be taken at a loss?
	Should the objects be equal to the recipe but come with a gold cost?
	Would the trader have a network with master craftsmen that would be more capable of producing the objects than you, or have machines that do it?
	In a post apocolypse would a trader cut a nice deal to someone that they saw as being capable of decreasing the zombie population around? Especially as time progresses it gets worse!
