	-Blade Trap can be upgraded at workstation to become a reinforced blade trap that does more damage and has more hitpoints
	
	-Burning Barrel can be upgraded with Gas to Burning Barrel Molotov that when walked on does molotov damage. This upgrade is time limited and the molotov version will turn back into the normal barrel after a set amount of time and you will need to upgrade the barrel again to add the molotov damage. Currently I have the barrel set in my mods to use heat damage rather than molotov damage.
	
		
Thoughts
	Blade Trap upgrade
	Dart Trap ammo items
	Turret ammo items
	Burning Barrel upgrade to molotov damage
